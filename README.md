I personally feel heart broken for my code, the poor coyote, not only in the show but also in my code can never seem to catch the road runner, no matter how much it tries. Hopefully one of these days it may catch it, Or if you wanna be a cheater you can also just stop it with the power of the mouse, but no one likes a cheater, unless you're starting to feel bad for the coyote.
